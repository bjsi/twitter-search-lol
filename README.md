Pls fork if you want :). You need to add your own auth/cookie/csrf tokens. Idk if there's a better way to make the request without using the official API. Warning: code is very quick and dirty

## How To Use

- Open index.js.
- Replace your own auth/cookie/csrf tokens.
- Copy and paste into the console in Twitter.

TODO:

- [x] basic UI
- [ ] make it so you can actually select search results.
